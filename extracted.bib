  abstract =      {The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological
                   effects of climate change is whether species will be
                   able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their
                   changing environment. If we establish the maximal
                   rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to
                   the rate at which temperatures can increase without
                   loss of biodiversity. The rate of adaptation will
                   primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since
                   (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as
                   reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence
                   microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii)
                   learning will be favourable to the individual but
                   cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii)
                   maternal effects may play a role but, as with other
                   forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of
                   offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be
                   adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv)
                   adaptation via immigration of individuals with
                   genotypes adapted to warmer environments also
                   involves microevolution as these genotypes are better
                   adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of,
                   for instance, photoperiod.Long-term studies on wild
                   populations with individually known animals play an
                   essential role in detecting and understanding the
                   temporal trends in life-history traits, and to
                   estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures
                   on, life-history traits. However, additional
                   measurements on other trophic levels and on the
                   mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are
                   needed to predict the rate of microevolution,
                   especially under changing conditions. Using this
                   knowledge on heritability of, and selection on,
                   life-history traits, in combination with climate
                   scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of
                   adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final
                   step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to
                   make the link to population viability and from there
                   to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the
                   rate of adaptation is insufficient.},

  abstract =      {* It has been postulated that climate warming may
                   pose the greatest threat species in the tropics,
                   where ectotherms have evolved more thermal specialist
                   physiologies. Although species could rapidly respond
                   to environmental change through adaptation, little is
                   known about the potential for thermal adaptation,
                   especially in tropical species. * In the light of the
                   limited empirical evidence available and predictions
                   from mutation-selection theory, we might expect
                   tropical ectotherms to have limited genetic variance
                   to enable adaptation. However, as a consequence of
                   thermodynamic constraints, we might expect this
                   disadvantage to be at least partially offset by a
                   fitness advantage, that is, the ‘hotter-is-better'
                   hypothesis. * Using an established quantitative
                   genetics model and metabolic scaling relationships,
                   we integrate the consequences of the opposing forces
                   of thermal specialization and thermodynamic
                   constraints on adaptive potential by evaluating
                   extinction risk under climate warming. We conclude
                   that the potential advantage of a higher maximal
                   development rate can in theory more than offset the
                   potential disadvantage of lower genetic variance
                   associated with a thermal specialist strategy. *
                   Quantitative estimates of extinction risk are
                   fundamentally very sensitive to estimates of
                   generation time and genetic variance. However, our
                   qualitative conclusion that the relative risk of
                   extinction is likely to be lower for tropical species
                   than for temperate species is robust to assumptions
                   regarding the effects of effective population size,
                   mutation rate and birth rate per capita. * With a
                   view to improving ecological forecasts, we use this
                   modelling framework to review the sensitivity of our
                   predictions to the model's underpinning theoretical
                   assumptions and the empirical basis of
                   macroecological patterns that suggest thermal
                   specialization and fitness increase towards the
                   tropics. We conclude by suggesting priority areas for
                   further empirical research.},

                   for evolutionary responses to environmental changes
                   is to large extent unknown. Here it is shown that
                   interspecific competition may slow down rates of
                   adaptation substantially and fundamentally change
                   patterns of adaptation to long-term environmental
                   changes. In the model investigated here, species
                   compete for resources distributed along an ecological
                   niche space. Environmental change is represented by a
                   slowly moving resource maximum and evolutionary
                   responses of single species are compared with
                   responses of coalitions of two and three competing
                   species. In scenarios with two and three species,
                   species that are favored by increasing resource
                   availability increase in equilibrium population size
                   whereas disfavored species decline in size. Increased
                   competition makes it less favorable for individuals
                   of a disfavored species to occupy a niche close to
                   the maximum and reduces the selection pressure for
                   tracking the moving resource distribution.
                   Individual-based simulations and an analysis using
                   adaptive dynamics show that the combination of weaker
                   selection pressure and reduced population size
                   reduces the evolutionary rate of the disfavored
                   species considerably. If the resource landscape moves
                   stochastically, weak evolutionary responses cause
                   large fluctuations in population size and thereby
                   large extinction risk for competing species, whereas
                   a single species subject to the same environmental
                   variability may track the resource maximum closely
                   and maintain a much more stable population size.
                   Other studies have shown that competitive
                   interactions may amplify changes in mean population
                   sizes due to environmental changes and thereby
                   increase extinction risks. This study accentuates the
                   harmful role of competitive interactions by
                   illustrating that they may also decrease rates of
                   adaptation. The slowdown in evolutionary rates caused
                   by competition may also contribute to explain low
                   rates of morphological change in spite of large
                   environmental fluctuations found in fossil records.},

                   standard models track the relative rather than
                   absolute fitness of genotypes, while the exceptions
                   describe only the short-term transition from imminent
                   doom to evolutionary rescue. But extinction can
                   result from failure to adapt not only to
                   catastrophes, but also to a backlog of environmental
                   challenges. We model long-term evolution to long
                   series of small challenges, where fitter populations
                   reach higher population sizes. The population's
                   long-term fitness dynamic is well approximated by a
                   simple stochastic Markov chain model. Long-term
                   persistence occurs when the rate of adaptation
                   exceeds the rate of environmental deterioration for
                   some genotypes. Long-term persistence times are
                   consistent with typical fossil species persistence
                   times of several million years. Immediately preceding
                   extinction, fitness declines rapidly, appearing as
                   though a catastrophe disrupted a stably established
                   population, even though gradual evolutionary
                   processes are responsible. New populations go through
                   an establishment phase where, despite being
                   demographically viable, their extinction risk is
                   elevated. Should the population survive long enough,
                   extinction risk later becomes constant over time.},

                   conservation context to predict the fate of small or
                   declining populations. Persistence models have
                   explored effects on extinction of random demographic
                   and environmental fluctuations, but in the face of
                   directional environmental change they should also
                   integrate factors affecting whether a population can
                   adapt. Here, we examine the population-size
                   dependence of demographic and genetic factors and
                   their likely contributions to extinction time under
                   scenarios of environmental change. Parameter
                   estimates were derived from experimental populations
                   of the rainforest species, Drosophila birchii, held
                   in the lab for 10 generations at census sizes of 20,
                   100 and 1000, and later exposed to five generations
                   of heat-knockdown selection. Under a model of
                   directional change in the thermal environment, rapid
                   extinction of populations of size 20 was caused by a
                   combination of low growth rate (r) and high
                   stochasticity in r. Populations of 100 had
                   significantly higher reproductive output, lower
                   stochasticity in r and more additive genetic variance
                   (V(A)) than populations of 20, but they were
                   predicted to persist less well than the largest size
                   class. Even populations of 1000 persisted only a few
                   hundred generations under realistic estimates of
                   environmental change because of low V(A) for
                   heat-knockdown resistance. The experimental results
                   document population-size dependence of demographic
                   and adaptability factors. The simulations illustrate
                   a threshold influence of demographic factors on
                   population persistence, while genetic variance has a

                   micro-evolutionary change compares with the rate of
                   environmental change, given that theoretically there
                   is a 'critical rate of environmental change' beyond
                   which increased maladaptation leads to population
                   extinction. Here, we parametrize two closely related
                   models to predict this critical rate using data from
                   a long-term study of great tits (Parus major). We
                   used stochastic dynamic programming to predict
                   changes in optimal breeding time under three
                   different climate scenarios. Using these results we
                   parametrized two theoretical models to predict
                   critical rates. Results from both models agreed
                   qualitatively in that even 'mild' rates of climate
                   change would be close to these critical rates with
                   respect to great tit breeding time, while for
                   scenarios close to the upper limit of IPCC climate
                   projections the calculated critical rates would be
                   clearly exceeded with possible consequences for
                   population persistence. We therefore tentatively
                   conclude that micro-evolution, together with
                   plasticity, would rescue only the population from
                   mild rates of climate change, although the models

                   particular on the contribution of phenotypic
                   plasticity to population persistence. Despite using
                   conservative estimates for evolutionary and
                   reproductive potential, our results suggest little
                   risk of population extinction under projected local
                   temperature change; however, this conclusion relies
                   heavily on the extent to which phenotypic plasticity
                   tracks the changing environment. Extrapolating the
                   model to a broad range of life histories in birds
                   suggests that the importance of phenotypic plasticity
                   for adjustment to projected rates of temperature
                   change increases with slower life histories, owing to
                   lower evolutionary potential. Understanding the
                   determinants and constraints on phenotypic plasticity
                   in natural populations is thus crucial for
                   characterising the risks that rapidly changing
                   environments pose for the persistence of such

                   states are constrained. Genetic constraints occur
                   when additive genetic variance in selectively favored
                   directions is absent (absolute constraints) or
                   present but small (quantitative constraints).
                   Quantitative--unlike absolute--constraints are
                   presumed surmountable given time. This ignores that a
                   population might become extinct before reaching the
                   favored state, in which case demography effectively
                   converts a quantitative into an absolute constraint.
                   Here, we derive criteria for predicting when such
                   conversions occur. We model the demography and
                   evolution of populations subject to optimizing
                   selection that experience either a single shift or a
                   constant change in the optimum. In the single-shift
                   case, we consider whether a population can evolve
                   significantly without declining or else declines
                   temporarily while avoiding low sizes consistent with
                   high extinction risk. We analyze when populations in
                   constantly changing environments evolve sufficiently
                   to ensure long-term growth. From these, we derive
                   formulas for critical levels of genetic variability
                   that define demography-caused absolute constraints.
                   The formulas depend on estimable properties of
                   fitness, population size, or environmental change
                   rates. Each extends to selection on multivariate
                   traits. Our criteria define the nearly null space of
                   a population's G matrix, the set of multivariate
                   directions effectively inaccessible to it via
                   adaptive evolution.},

                   temporally varying environments is investigated on
                   the basis of a quantitative-genetic multilocus model.
                   Populations are finite, subject to density-dependent
                   regulation with a finite growth rate, diploid, and
                   either asexual or randomly mating and sexual with or
                   without recombination. A quantitative trait is
                   determined by a finite number of loci at which
                   mutation generates genetic variability. The trait is
                   under stabilizing selection with an optimum that
                   either changes at a constant rate in one direction,
                   exhibits periodic cycling, or fluctuates randomly. It
                   is shown by Monte Carlo simulations that if the
                   directional-selection component prevails, then freely
                   recombining populations gain a substantial
                   evolutionary advantage over nonrecombining and
                   asexual populations that goes far beyond that
                   recognized in previous studies. The reason is that in
                   such populations, the genetic variance can increase
                   substantially and thus enhance the rate of
                   adaptation. In nonrecombining and asexual
                   populations, no or much less increase of variance
                   occurs. It is explored by simulation and mathematical
                   analysis when, why, and by how much genetic variance
                   increases in response to environmental change. In
                   particular, it is elucidated how this change in
                   genetic variance depends on the reproductive system,
                   the population size, and the selective regime, and
                   what the consequences for population persistence

                   rate and extent of anthropogenic alterations of the

                   genetic, and demographic mechanisms that populations
                   have evolved to deal with environmental change. To
                   begin to understand the limits to population
                   persistence, we present a simple evolutionary model
                   for the critical rate of environmental change beyond
                   which a population must decline and go extinct. We
                   use this model to highlight the major determinants of
                   extinction risk in a changing environment, and
                   identify research needs for improved predictions
                   based on projected changes in environmental
                   variables. Two key parameters relating the
                   environment to population biology have not yet
                   received sufficient attention. Phenotypic plasticity,
                   the direct influence of environment on the
                   development of individual phenotypes, is increasingly
                   considered an important component of phenotypic
                   change in the wild and should be incorporated in
                   models of population persistence. Environmental
                   sensitivity of selection, the change in the optimum
                   phenotype with the environment, still crucially needs
                   empirical assessment. We use environmental tolerance
                   curves and other examples of ecological and
                   evolutionary responses to climate change to
                   illustrate how these mechanistic approaches can be

                   history) affects the tempo of adaptive evolution to
                   change remains unclear. We used a heuristic model to
                   explore how commonly observed features associated
                   with marine com- plex life histories alter a
                   population's capacity to cope with environmental
                   change. We found that increasing the complexity of
                   the life history generally reduces the evolutionary
                   potential of taxa to cope with environmental change.
                   Our model also predicted that genetic correlations in
                   stress tolerance between stages, levels of genetic
                   variance in each stage, and the relative plasticity

                   Here we extend previous analyses with a static
                   optimum to allow the environment to vary in time as
                   well as in space. The model follows both population

                   comparing the loads due to genetic variance,
                   dispersal, and temporal change. With fixed genetic
                   variance, we obtain two regimes: (1) adaptation that

                   the population therefore becomes locally extinct and

                   pollen dispersal slows the range shift in space but
                   facilitates the evolution of new climatic niche
                   limits, such that the species becomes adapted to
                   warmer conditions. Therefore, current predictions of
                   the future spatial distribution of plants, as well as
                   current assessments of the extinction risk due to
                   climate warming, could be significantly altered for
                   plants, especially those dispersing pollen far
                   compared with seeds. Species may survive climate
                   change by migrating to track favorable climates
                   and/or adapting to different climates. Several
                   quantitative genetics models predict that species
                   escaping extinction will change their geographical
                   distribution while keeping the same ecological niche.
                   We introduce pollen dispersal in these models, which
                   affects gene flow but not directly colonization. We
                   show that plant populations may escape extinction
                   because of both spatial range and ecological niche
                   shifts. Exact analytical formulas predict that
                   increasing pollen dispersal distance slows the
                   expected spatial range shift and accelerates the
                   ecological niche shift. There is an optimal distance
                   of pollen dispersal, which maximizes the sustainable
                   rate of climate change. These conclusions hold in
                   simulations relaxing several strong assumptions of
                   our analytical model. Our results imply that, for
                   plants with long distance of pollen dispersal, models
                   assuming niche conservatism may not accurately
                   predict their future distribution under climate
                   change.},

                   Stress is a reduction in fitness that can also alter
                   the selection on new mutations. Although the effects
                   of environmental and genetic stresses are typically
                   studied separately, it is useful to consider them
                   from the same perspective. Here we evaluate the
                   common perception that stress increases selection. We
                   consider various conceptual paradigms for thinking
                   about selection and stress, and then review the

                   different types of stresses affect selection
                   differently, though the underlying mechanisms are, as
                   yet, unclear in most cases. {\textcopyright} 2010

                   with a long history, but which was named and
                   rigorously defined relatively recently. It is closely
                   related to the logarithmic function, and arises from
                   many models in the natural sciences, including a
                   surprising number of problems in ecology and
                   evolution. 2.I describe the basic properties of the
                   function, and present examples of its application to
                   models of ecological and evolutionary processes.
                   3.The Lambert W function makes it possible to solve
                   explicitly several models where this is not possible
                   with elementary functions. I present examples of such

                   may be averted through advanced detection. Recent
                   work has provided a proof-of-principle that many
                   systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be
                   identified through the lens of early warning
                   indicators such as rising variance or increased
                   return times. Despite widespread appreciation of the
                   difficulties and uncertainty involved in such
                   forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize
                   their expected error rates. Without the benefits of
                   replicates, controls, or hindsight, applications of
                   these approaches must quantify how reliable different
                   indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how
                   sensitive they are to missing subtle warning signs.
                   We propose a model based approach in order to
                   quantify this trade-off between reliability and
                   sensitivity and allow comparisons between different
                   indicators. We show these error rates can be quite
                   severe for common indicators even under favorable
                   assumptions, and also illustrate how a model-based
                   indicator can improve this performance. We
                   demonstrate how the performance of an early warning
                   indicator varies in different data sets, and suggest
                   that uncertainty quantification become a more central
                   part of early warning predictions.},

                   climate have often been interrupted by sharp
                   transitions to a contrasting state. One explanation
                   for such events of abrupt change is that they
                   happened when the earth system reached a critical
                   tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove
                   for events in the remote past, and it is even more
                   difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
                   tipping point for abrupt climate change in the
                   future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate
                   shifts and show that they were all preceded by a
                   characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations
                   starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing
                   down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be
                   mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping
                   points. Therefore, our results imply independent
                   empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt
                   shifts were associated with the passing of critical
                   thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing
                   down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it
                   follows that our way to detect slowing down might be
                   used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming
                   catastrophic change. Because tipping points in
                   ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously
                   hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising
                   perspective.},

                   genetic variation in fitness results in evolutionary
                   change. This dual importance of individual fitness is
                   well understood, but empirical fitness records
                   generally violate the assumptions of standard
                   statistical approaches. This problem has undermined
                   comprehensive study of fitness and impeded empirical
                   synthesis of the numerical and genetic dynamics of
                   populations. Recently developed aster models remedy
                   this problem by explicitly modeling the dependence of
                   later-expressed components of fitness (e.g.,
                   fecundity) on those expressed earlier (e.g., survival
                   to reproduce). Moreover, aster models employ
                   different sampling distributions for different
                   components of fitness (e.g., binomial for survival
                   over a given interval and Poisson for fecundity).
                   Analysis is done by maximum likelihood, and the
                   resulting distributions for lifetime fitness closely
                   approximate observed data. We illustrate the breadth
                   of aster models' utility with three examples
                   demonstrating estimation of the finite rate of
                   increase, comparison of mean fitness among genotypic
                   groups, and analysis of phenotypic selection. Aster
                   models offer a unified approach to addressing the
                   breadth of questions in evolution and ecology for
                   which life-history data are gathered.},

  abstract =      {Since 1983, study of natural selection has relied
                   heavily on multiple regression of fitness on the
                   values for a set of traits via ordinary least squares
                   (OLSs), as proposed by Lande and Arnold, to obtain an
                   estimate of the quadratic relationship between
                   fitness and the traits, the fitness surface. However,
                   well-known statistical problems with this approach
                   can affect inferences about selection. One key
                   concern is that measures of lifetime fitness do not
                   conform to a normal or any other standard sampling
                   distribution, as needed to justify the usual
                   statistical tests. Another is that OLS may yield an
                   estimate of the sign of the fitness function's
                   curvature that is opposite to the truth. We here show
                   that the recently developed aster modeling approach,
                   which explicitly models the components of fitness as
                   the basis for inferences about lifetime fitness,
                   eliminates these problems. We illustrate selection
                   analysis via aster using simulated datasets involving
                   five fitness components expressed in each of four
                   years. We demonstrate that aster analysis yields
                   accurate estimates of the fitness function in cases
                   in which OLS misleads, as well as accurate confidence
                   regions for directional selection gradients. Further,
                   to evaluate selection when many traits are under
                   consideration, we recommend model selection by
                   information criteria and frequentist model

                   iteroparous species or have usually been limited to
                   one particular event during an organism's lifetime.
                   Using an animal-model restricted maximum likelihood
                   and phenotypic selection models, we estimated

                   Litter size at birth and parturition date had low

                   considered aspects of either offspring or maternal
                   phenotype, and their evolution will therefore depend
                   on selection operating through offspring and maternal
                   components of fitness. Furthermore, selection at
                   these levels may be antagonistic, with optimal
                   offspring and maternal fitness occurring at different
                   phenotypic values. We examined selection regimes on
                   the correlated traits of birth weight, birth date,
                   and litter size in Soay sheep (Ovis aries) using data
                   from a long-term study of a free-living population on
                   the archipelago of St. Kilda, Scotland. We tested the
                   hypothesis that selective constraints on the
                   evolution of the multivariate phenotype arise through
                   antagonistic selection, either acting at offspring
                   and maternal levels, or on correlated aspects of
                   phenotype. All three traits were found to be under
                   selection through variance in short-term and lifetime
                   measures of fitness. Analysis of lifetime fitness
                   revealed strong positive directional selection on
                   birth weight and weaker selection for increased birth
                   date at both levels. However, there was also evidence
                   for stabilizing selection on these traits at the
                   maternal level, with reduced fitness at high
                   phenotypic values indicating lower phenotypic optima
                   for mothers than for offspring. Additionally,
                   antagonistic selection was found on litter size. From
                   the offspring's point of view it is better to be born
                   a singleton, whereas maternal fitness increases with
                   average litter size. The decreased fitness of twins
                   is caused by their reduced birth weight; therefore,
                   this antagonistic selection likely results from
                   trade-offs between litter size and birth weight that
                   have different optimal resolutions with respect to
                   offspring and maternal fitness. Our results highlight
                   how selection regimes may vary depending on the
                   assignment of reproductive and early life-history
                   traits to either offspring or maternal phenotype.},

                   Previous work on threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
                   aculeatus) has revealed that dorsal and pelvic spines
                   are a defense against gape-limited predators but may
                   be detrimental against grappling insect predators. In
                   this study, we examined a 15-year database from an
                   endemic population of threespine stickleback to look
                   for evidence of temporal shifts in exposure to these
                   divergent predation regimes and correlated shifts in
                   selection on spine number. For juveniles, we detected
                   selection for increased spine number during winter
                   when gape-limited avian piscivores were most common
                   but selection for decreased spine number during
                   summer when odonate predation was more common. For
                   subadults and adults, which are taken primarily by
                   avian piscivores, we predicted selection should
                   generally be for increased spine number in all
                   seasons. Among 59 comparisons, four selection
                   differentials were significant (Bonferroni corrected)
                   and in the predicted direction. However, there was
                   also substantial variability in remaining
                   differentials, including two examples with strong
                   selection for spine reduction. These reversals were
                   associated with increased tendency of the fish to
                   shift to a benthic niche, as determined from
                   examination of stomach contents. These dietary data
                   suggest that increased encounter rates with odonate
                   predation select for spine reduction. Strong
                   selection on spine number was followed by changes in
                   mean spine number during subsequent years and a
                   standard quantitative genetic formula revealed that
                   spine number has a heritable component. Our results
                   provide evidence of rapid morphological responses to
                   selection from predators and suggest that temporal
                   variation in selection may help maintain variation
                   within populations. Furthermore, our findings
                   indicate that variable selection can be predicted if
                   the agents of selection are known.},

                   opportunities, with sexual selection driving the
                   evolution of large body size and weaponry through the
                   advantage they confer for access to females. Few
                   studies have explored potential trade-offs of
                   investment in secondary sexual traits between
                   different components of fitness or tested for
                   sexually antagonistic selection pressures. These
                   factors may provide explanations for observed
                   polymorphisms in both form and quality of secondary
                   sexual traits. We report here an analysis of
                   selection on horn phenotype in a feral population of
                   Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island of Hirta, St.
                   Kilda, Scotland. Soay sheep display a phenotypic
                   polymorphism for horn type with males growing either
                   normal or reduced (scurred) horns, and females
                   growing either normal, scurred, or no (polled) horns;
                   further variation in size exists within horn morphs.
                   We show that horn phenotype and the size of the trait
                   displayed is subject to different selection pressures
                   in males and females, generating sexually
                   antagonistic selection. Furthermore, there was
                   evidence of a trade-off between breeding success and
                   longevity in normal-horned males, with both the
                   normal horn type and larger horn size being
                   associated with greater annual breeding success but
                   reduced longevity. Therefore, selection through
                   lifetime breeding success was not found to act upon
                   horn phenotype in males. In females, a negative
                   association of annual breeding success within the
                   normal-horned phenotype did not result in a
                   significant difference in lifetime fitness when
                   compared to scurred individuals, as no significant
                   difference in longevity was found. However, increased
                   horn size within this group was negatively associated
                   with breeding success and longevity. Females without
                   horns (polled) suffered reduced longevity and thus
                   reduced lifetime breeding success relative the other
                   horn morphs. Our results therefore suggest that
                   trade-offs between different components of fitness
                   and antagonistic selection between the sexes may
                   maintain genetic variation for secondary sexual
                   traits within a population.},

                   on and insights into the process of evolution in
                   natural populations. However, traditional linear and
                   quadratic selection analyses are not capable of
                   detecting other features of fitness functions, such
                   as asymmetry or thresholds, which may be relevant for
                   understanding key aspects of selection on many
                   traits. In these cases, additional analyses are
                   needed to test specific hypotheses about fitness
                   functions. In this study we used several approaches
                   to analyze selection on a major life-history
                   trait—flowering time—in the annual plant Brassica
                   rapa subjected to experimentally abbreviated and
                   lengthened growing seasons. We used a model that
                   incorporated a tradeoff between the time allocated to
                   growth versus the time allocated to reproduction in
                   order to predict fitness function shape. The model
                   predicted that optimal flowering time shifts to
                   earlier and later dates as the growing season
                   contracts and expands. It also showed the flowering
                   time fitness function to be asymmetrical:
                   reproductive output increases modestly between the
                   earliest and the optimal flowering date, but then
                   falls sharply with later dates, truncating in a
                   ‘tail of zeros'. Our experimental results strongly
                   supported selection for early flowering in short
                   season and selection for late flowering in long
                   season conditions. We also found support for the
                   predicted asymmetry of the flowering time fitness
                   function, including a ‘tail of zeros' at later
                   flowering dates. The form of the fitness function
                   revealed here has implications for interpreting
                   estimates of selection on flowering time in natural
                   populations and for refining predictions on
                   evolutionary response to climate change. More
                   generally, this study illustrates the value of
                   diverse statistical approaches to understanding

                   fitness effects. We found that up to 38% of pairs had
                   significant epistasis for fitness, including both
                   positive and negative deviations from the null
                   hypothesis of multiplicative effects. Interestingly,
                   the sign of epistasis was correlated with viral
                   protein-protein interactions in a model network,
                   being predominantly positive between linked pairs of
                   proteins and negative between unlinked ones.
                   Furthermore, 55% of significant interactions were
                   cases of reciprocal sign epistasis (RSE), indicating
                   that adaptive landscapes for RNA viruses maybe highly
                   rugged. Finally, we found that the magnitude of
                   epistasis correlated negatively with the average
                   effect of mutations. Overall, our results are in good
                   agreement to those previously reported for other
                   viruses and further consolidate the view that
                   positive epistasis is the norm for small and compact
                   genomes that lack genetic robustness.},
